**A lightweight tool for parsing and organizing Spotify track data.**

A program that retrieves track URLs from Spotify, extracts their unique track IDs, and exports the information to a CSV file for backup or analysis.

I built this project to practice GitHub version control, learn a new web API integration, and organize my music collection in a structured format.
Throughout development, I explored data batching, time processing, Spotify's Web API, and file conversion techniques.

## Overview/Background

I built this project to strengthen my understanding of GitHub version control, experiment with an unfamiliar API, and maintain a reliable copy of my music library given how digital streaming rights change.
With this tool I can rebuild playlists if Spotify loses access to certain tracks or recreate my library on any other platform.

This program not only benefits my own learning and usage, but also anyone who wishes to preserve or analyze their Spotify playlists for migration or personal archiving.

While building it, I learned how to manage batching and timed delays to comply with Spotify’s Web API rate limits and explored integrating a new Python library to handle those tasks efficiently.

## Features

### Current Features

The following outlines the core capabilities of the current build and planned improvements.

- Reads track URLs from a local text file
- Extracts Spotify track IDs from each URL
- Groups IDs into batches for clean and efficient parsing
- Converts parsed IDs to a human readable format
- Writes converted track data to a CSV file
- Handles time delay logic to respect API limits
- Uses Spotify OAuth for secure authorization
- Runs in a simple Python environment (no GUI required)

### Planned Enhancements

- Parse additional track information from IDs, such as genre and album
- Create alternative formatting options, such as JSON
- Add a function to organize artists by name, track, or genre alphabetically

## Project Structure

```
Spotify_Track_Exporter/
|
|-- Track_Exporter.py
|-- Batching_and_Extracting.py
|-- scratchwork.py
|-- track_list.csv
|-- Full_Links.txt
```
This repository contains the primary program, Track_Exporter.py; a prototyping file, Batching_and_Extracting; a file for small tests and to flesh out ideas, scratchwork.py; the CSV file generated by the program, track_list.csv; and the text file containing the Spotify links that need to be parsed, Full_Links.txt.

Together, these files handle reading the Spotify URLs, extracting track IDs, batching them for efficient processing, and exporting the parsed data into a structured format.

## Concepts / Workflow

The program follows a simple multi-step process from raw input to exported data.

1. __Input:__ the user supplies Spotify track links in `Full_Links.txt`.
2. __Cleaning:__ the program trims each line to remove extra text or spaces.
3. __Parsing:__ each link is reduced to a Spotify Track ID.
4. __Batching:__ those IDs are grouped into sets (for rate-limit compliance).
5. __Exporting:__ each batch is written to `track_list.csv`.
6. __Going Forward:__ The data can later be extended with additional fields like genre or album.

## Setup / Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python version 3.10+
- Spotify account and music library
- Spotify Developer account (for API credentials)
- Git (optional, for cloning)

### Setup Steps

Follow these steps to set up and run the program on your local machine.

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment.
3. Install dependencies.
4. Create a `.env` file or environment variables for credentials.

### Example Commands 

``` bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate # or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install spotipy
```

### Important Note About Credentials

REMEMBER: Do NOT share your Spotify client ID or client secret! They expire after one hour, but it is good practice to keep them out of the main program and in a separate, secure location.

## Authentication / Configuration

This project gets the track information needed from Spotify; you'll need to use Spotify's OAuth 2.0 authorization to access your data through the API. To authenticate successfully, you'll need to create a Spotify Developer account and register your app to obtain a Client ID, Client Secret, and Redirect URI.

### Steps
1. Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).
2. Create a new app and copy the *Client ID* and *Client Secret*.
3. Add your *Redirect URI* - this must match exactly in your code and developer settings.
4. Store these values in your `.env` file or as environment variables.
5. Spotify uses these credentials to handle token generation and automatic refresh.

Keep your credentials private and never commit them to version control.

## How It Works

This tool takes a list of Spotify track links, extracts the unique track ID, and processes them in batches of 50 IDs (the limit allowed by Spotify's Web API). Each batch is sent to the API, which returns each track's metadata. The program then writes the results to a CSV file for easy export, archiving, or analysis.

### High-Level Flow
1. Load input file: Read track links from `Full_Links.txt`
2. Clean links: Strip whitespace and remove unneeded text
3. Extract IDs: Convert each link to its 22-character Spotify Track ID
4. Generate batches: Group IDs into digestible chunks
5. API requests: Fetch song name and artist details
6. Output: Append each batch's results to `track_list.csv`

The script prints progress throughout the run to make it easier to monitor large playlists and diagnose issues.

## Usage

After setup and authentication, using the exporter is simple:

1. Add Spotify links from your Spotify library:
   - Open Spotify
   - Select the playlist
   - Use CTRL + A to select all tracks
   - Use CTRL + C to copy the track URLs from the selected tracks
   - Use CTRL + V to paste the links into Notepad or the desired text editor
   - Name the file `Full_Links.txt`.
2. Activate your virtual environment
3. Run the script
   ```bash
   python Track_Exporter.py
   ```
4. Once complete, open `track_list.csv` to view your exported results

On larger playlists, the processing time may vary depending on Spotify's rate limits and network speed, but batching keeps things stable and predictable.

## Output Format

The output file, `track_list.csv`, currently contains three columns.

| Column       | Description                                       |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Track ID     | Sequential numeric ID, based on your link order   |
| Song         | Track name returned by Spotify                    |
| Artist(s)    | Comma-separated list of contributing artists      |

This keeps the structure simple and easy to extend later (adding album name, genre, popularity, or release date).
