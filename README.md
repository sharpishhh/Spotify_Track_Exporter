# Spotify Track Exporter

**A lightweight tool for parsing and organizing Spotify track data.**

A program that retrieves track URLs from Spotify, extracts their unique track IDs, and exports the information to a CSV file for backup or analysis.

I built this project to practice GitHub version control, learn a new web API integration, and organize my music collection in a structured format.
Throughout development, I explored data batching, time processing, Spotify's Web API, and file conversion techniques.

## Overview/Background

I built this project to strengthen my understanding of GitHub version control, experiment with an unfamiliar API, and maintain a reliable copy of my music library given how digital streaming rights change.
With this tool I can rebuild playlists if Spotify loses access to certain tracks or recreate my library on any other platform.

This program not only benefits my own learning and usage, but also anyone who wishes to preserve or analyze their Spotify playlists for migration or personal archiving.

While building it, I learned how to manage batching and timed delays to comply with Spotify’s Web API rate limits and explored integrating a new Python library to handle those tasks efficiently.
