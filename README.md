# Spotify Track Exporter

**A lightweight tool for parsing and organizing Spotify track data.**

A program that retrieves track URLs from Spotify, extracts their unique track IDs, and exports the information to a CSV file for backup or analysis.

I built this project to practice GitHub version control, learn a new web API integration, and organize my music collection in a structured format.
Throughout development, I explored data batching, time processing, Spotify's Web API, and file conversion techniques.

## Overview/Background

I built this project to strengthen my understanding of GitHub version control, experiment with an unfamiliar API, and maintain a reliable copy of my music library given how digital streaming rights change.
With this tool I can rebuild playlists if Spotify loses access to certain tracks or recreate my library on any other platform.

This program not only benefits my own learning and usage, but also anyone who wishes to preserve or analyze their Spotify playlists for migration or personal archiving.

While building it, I learned how to manage batching and timed delays to comply with Spotify’s Web API rate limits and explored integrating a new Python library to handle those tasks efficiently.

## Features

### Current Features

The following outlines the core capabilities of the current build and planned improvements.

- Reads track URLs from a local text file
- Extracts Spotify track IDs from each URL
- Groups IDs into batches for clean and efficient parsing
- Converts parsed IDs to a human readable format
- Writes converted track data to a CSV File
- Handles time delay logic to respect API limits
- Uses Spotify OAuth for secure authorization
- Runs in a simple Python environment (no GUI required)

### Planned Enhancements

- Parse additional track information from IDs, such as genre and album
- Create alternative formatting options, such as JSON
- Add a function to organize artists by name, track, or genre alphabetically

## Project Structure

```
Spotify_Track_Exporter/
|
|-- Track_Exporter.py
|-- Batching_and_Extracting.py
|-- scratchwork.py
|-- track_list.csv
|__ Full_Links.txt
```
This repository contains the primary program, Track_Exporter.py; a prototyping file, Batching_and_Extracting; a file for small tests and to flesh out ideas, scratchwork.py; the CSV file generated by the program, track_list.csv; and the text file containing the Spotify links that need to be parsed, Full_Links.txt.

Together, these files handle reading the Spotify URLs, extracting track IDs, batching them for efficient processing, and exporting the parsed data into a structured format.
